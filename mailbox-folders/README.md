Mailbox Folders
===============

[Read description here](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=14714663).

I believe the output is wrong! It's missing the indentation levels.

Also, there's no mention about the order of the nodes in the list. I'm assuming alphabetical.

Run with `ruby mailbox_folders.rb < test_case.txt`.
