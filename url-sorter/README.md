Url Sorter
==========

This is my take, in Ruby, for the Url sorter problem proposed [here](http://blog.jasonmooberry.com/2012/09/what-i-learned-from-my-first-c-coding-challenge/).

The result was lame, in terms of efficiency:

    #   1.210000   0.000000   1.210000 (  1.205235)

But it's ok, as a practice :P
