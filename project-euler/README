My solutions for http://projecteuler.net/ problems.
I made these programs to study ruby language.
I follow the rules of the project:
* programs should find the correct answer under one minute
* you shouldn't look for ways to solve the problem on the web before you completed it
This second rule I am not always strict about - I comment on the code when it's the case.
Most of the times I don't get the most efficient or beautiful code possible. But
that's fine for the purpose: learing the ruby language.

Hope you enjoy reading this code :D
